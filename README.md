# C_guides: Hardcore C Learning

Grinding C the heavy way—low-level mastery in progress.

## Structure
- **src/**: Code—basics to advanced.
- **notes/**: Deep dives—concepts explained.
- **scripts/**: Build/debug tools.

## Progress
- [x] Allocation: Compile vs. runtime (`src/allocation/`, `notes/allocation.md`)
- [x] Structs: Pointers, packing (`src/structs/`, `notes/structs.md`)
- [ ] Syscalls: Kernel-level C

## Latest
- Fixed `String` struct segfault—dynamic strings (`src/structs/string.c`).

## Ongoing
- Writing a frame sniffer in c (capturing and analyzing frames)
